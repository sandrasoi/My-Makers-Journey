###Monday 4th September
I learned the basics of using the command line to manipulate files and directories.
I used commands such as pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, touch, rm -r, cp and mv.
I learned how to print working directory, list files, change / create/ destroy directories, list hidden files, create/ copy/ move files.

I learned about GIT and how it is used to make different versions of code like a checkpoint that can be returned to in case there are issues with later versions. Firstly by using the staging area and then commiting it to a specific version.
