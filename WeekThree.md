<h1>Week3</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>

- Learning to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
- Learn to break programs up into classes.
- Learn to debug your programs.
- Learn to build software as a pair.
- Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.


<h3>Monday 18th September</h3>

Today is the beginning of a new module where I will learn about the golden squares of programming:
- Test-driving
- Object Oriented Design
- Debugging
- Pairing

Today I revised my understanding of git by cloning a repository from GitHub and setting up a git repository on my computer. I learned how to write tests for simple programs and how to write a test when an 'Exception' is used in the program. I learned about the differences between freerunning development and test-driven approach. The test-driven approach consists of a red phase, green phase and then refactoring phase. I created simple programs using this test-driven approach. 

<h3>Tuesday 19th September</h3>

I worked in a pair today to complete a test [driven challenge](https://github.com/sandrasoi/Phase_Two_Challenge_3). The requirement was for the user to know how long it will take them to read a text based on their reading time and the length of the text. Together we created a plan that contained the what the problem was, designed the function signature such as the name, paramenters and return values, created example tests and then finally implemented this changes. We created a new repository to allow us to take turns working on the code, by pushing them to GitHub and pulling them from GitHub. Collaborating with others is a very useful tool as it allows me to see different ways of working and helps me become a better coder. 

<h3>Wednesday 20th September</h3>

I learned about two types of debugging: change and discovery debugging. Change debugging consists of making changes to the program and seeing what effect it has. This can work well in simple programs but when a program is complex, this is not a good method. Instead it is important to do discovery debugging which consists of understanding how the code executes, flow of control, which ifs and loops run and how many times, values of variables and how they change. A powerful tool to gain insight into the code is to gain visibility by running 'print' statements. I successfully debugged an [encoder_decoder program](https://github.com/sandrasoi/My-Makers-Journey/blob/main/My-Programs/Golden_Squares_Module/encoder_decoder.py) which I have never seen before by using this methodical approach. Firstly, I was getting an error that 'a' does not exist in the list. I printed the 'alphabet' variable and noticed that the alphabet starts at c not a, therefore, I fixed the code so that the list would start from a. Secondly, the decoder function was not decoding correctly. I understood how the encoder function works and based on that I discovered where the error was in the decoder function and fixed it.
