<h1>Week3</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
- Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.(</n>)
- Learn to break programs up into classes.(</n>)
- Learn to debug your programs.(</n>)
- Learn to build software as a pair.(</n>)
- Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

<h3>Monday 18th September</h3>

Today is the beginning of a new module where I will learn about the golden squares of programming:
- Test-driving
- Object Oriented Design
- Debugging
- Pairing

Today I revised my understanding of git by cloning a repository from GitHub and setting up a git repository on my computer. I learned how to write tests for simple programs and how to write a test when an 'Exception' is used in the program. I learned about the differences between freerunning development and test-driven approach. The test-driven approach consists of a red phase, green phase and then refactoring phase. I created simple programs using this test-driven approach.
