<h1>Week3</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
- Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
- Learn to break programs up into classes.
- Learn to debug your programs.
- Learn to build software as a pair.
- Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

<h3>Monday 18th September</h3>

Today is the beginning of a new module where I will learn about the golden squares of programming:
- Test-driving
- Object Oriented Design
- Debugging
- Pairing

Today I revised my understanding of git by cloning a repository from GitHub and setting up a git repository on my computer. I learned how to write tests for simple programs and how to write a test when an 'Exception' is used in the program. I learned about the differences between freerunning development and test-driven approach. The test-driven approach consists of a red phase, green phase and then refactoring phase. I created simple programs using this test-driven approach. 

<h3>Tuesday 19th September</h3>

I worked in a pair today to complete a test [driven challenge](https://github.com/sandrasoi/Phase_Two_Challenge_3). The requirement was for the user to know how long it will take them to read a text based on their reading time and the length of the text. Together we created a plan that contained the what the problem was, designed the function signature such as the name, paramenters and return values, created example tests and then finally implemented this changes. We created a new repository to allow us to take turns working on the code, by pushing them to GitHub and pulling them from GitHub. Collaborating with others is a very useful tool as it allows me to see different ways of working and helps me become a better coder.
