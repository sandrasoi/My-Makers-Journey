<h1>Week14 Security </h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>

- Explain the importance of security and its implications
- Use SAST and DAST tools to uncover security risks
- Use the practice of Threat Modelling to uncover security risks in a deployed application

<h3>Monday 4th December</h3>

I have focused today on understanding different security risks in an application. Injections are a big risk where someone with malicious intent could submit a form with code that hacks the system. In order to prevent that, the code has to validate against user inputs. It's also important not to store any sensitive enough in the HTML code which can be accessed by others. It also must not be easy to guess routes that could cause damage to the application such as commands to delete information collected. Debug mode has to be disabled as to not make it easy for hackers to figure things out about the application based on the error messages received.
