<h1>Week1</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
- Learn to manipulate files and directory structures using the command line.<br>
- Learn to track changes to your code using Git version control.<br>
- Learn to write small programs using Python.<br>

<h3>Monday 4th September</h3>
I learned the basics of using the command line to manipulate files and directories.
I used commands such as pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, touch, rm -r, cp and mv.
I learned how to print working directory, list files, change / create/ destroy directories, list hidden files, create/ copy/ move files.

<h3>Tuesday 5th Septemer</h3>
I learned about GIT and how it is used to make different versions of code and how it serves like a checkpoint that can be returned to in case there are issues with later versions. 
I learned how to initialise git repository, add items to the staging area and how to commit them. I also learned how to set up a remote to GitHub and how to push code to GitHub as well as pull updates and clone repositories from GitHub. I tested what I did by getting the git status or log.
I used commands such as git init, git add, gitt commit -m, git status, git log, git remote add origin, git push -u origin main, git pull and git clone.


I completed a challenge to test my knowledge and reflect on what I have learned by creating cmd_line_git_challenge1 in git and pushing it to GitHub.

<h3>Wednesday 6th Septemer</h3>
I learned about the basics of Python. Firstly, I learned how to use REPL to execute Python in the terminal. Then I learned about functions, methods, indexing to find specific strings based on their string position, for and while loops and if-else statements. This was mostly a recap for me as I have learned about these basics before. I also learned how to execute python files from the terminal using the command 'python3 file_name.py' and I also used pipenv to test my code using the command 'pipenv run pytest -x'.


To test my knowledge, I completed a simple [password validator program](https://github.com/sandrasoi/My-Makers-Journey/blob/main/My-Programs/password_validator.py) to validate a password by using if statements to check its length and whether it contains certain characters.

<h3>Thursday 7th Septemer</h3>
I learned about dictionaries and classes. I tested my knowledge by completing [drills](https://github.com/sandrasoi/My-Makers-Journey/blob/main/My-Programs/_1_lists_and_dictionaries.py) and validating them using the pipenv. I am getting more confident with using the command line and understanding how a virtual environment works.
