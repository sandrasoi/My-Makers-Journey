<h3>Monday 11th September</h3>

Today I finished off the password manager program. I initally made an error when adding a dictionary outside of the class. This led to any objects that were within the same class to use the same dictionary. I wanted each object to use a different dictionary. I reviewed the lesson on scope and realised I need to add the dictionary within the initilizer method and then to refer to the dictionary as self.[name_of_dictionary).  

I also learned about different data structures, specifically when using dictionaries including nested dictionaries and lists of dictionaries, and the different methods that can be used on both of these to extract information. I was also introducted to the filter and lambda functions which are functions that provide another way of iterating through items.

<h3>Tuesday 12th September</h3>

I started completing drills and reviewing lesson material to implement list comprehensions, filter, map and lambda functions. 
I learned that all objects in Python are part of a class and that some methods we call to an object are coded into their class such as .upper(). This helped me make sense of classes better.

<h3>Wednesday 13th September</h3>

I am continuing to completed drills to solidify my understanding of list comprehensions, filter, map and lambda functions. I also participated in a wellbeing session on feedback. It focused on reframing the perception of feedback to being a source of information, neither good nor bad. I also learned about communication stances and to take a kind approach when giving feedback. I also started doing codewars katas with my peers. This has been a great opportunity to do something fun and to compare different approaches each of us have to solving a problem.
