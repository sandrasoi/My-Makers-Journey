Today I finished off the password manager program. I initally made an error when adding a dictionary outside of the class. This led to any objects that were within the same class to use the same dictionary. I wanted each object to use a different dictionary. I reviewed the lesson on scope and realised I need to add the dictionary within the initilizer method and then to refer to the dictionary as self.[name_of_dictionary).
