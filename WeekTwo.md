Today I finished off the password manager program. I initally made an error when adding a dictionary outside of the class. This led to any objects that were within the same class to use the same dictionary. I wanted each object to use a different dictionary. I reviewed the lesson on scope and realised I need to add the dictionary within the initilizer method and then to refer to the dictionary as self.[name_of_dictionary).  

I also learned about different data structures, specifically when using dictionaries including nested dictionaries and lists of dictionaries, and the different methods that can be used on both of these to extract information. I was also introducted to the filter and lambda functions which are functions that provide another way of iterating through items.
