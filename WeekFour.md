I began designing a mutli-class system program to store diary entries containing to-dos, phone numbers and normal entries in a diary. Given only user stories, it was very challenging to work out how many classes were needed and their relationship with each other. I found pair programming really useful as it helped me to speak out loud my thoughts and design the program. 

<h3>Tuesday 26th September</h3>

I attended a workshop on using git when pair programming. I learned how to make new branches, merge them and resolve conflicts. When pair programming, I employed this technique to solidify my understanding. I used git checkout -b <name of branch> to create a new branch and git push --set-upstream origin <branch name> to push these changes to GitHub. I have been focused on developing better practises including regularly commiting my code at key stages of development.
