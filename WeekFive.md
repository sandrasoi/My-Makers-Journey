<h1>Week5</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>

- Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
- Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
- Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
- Explain how your program communicates with the database by creating a sequence diagram.

<h3>Monday 2nd October</h3>

Today I learned about SQL which is a language that lets us query, create or modify data stored in a database. Up until now, the programs we created only exitst in the memory so it is not good if data needs to be stored for a long time.

I set up PostgresSQL which is a rational database software to learn about databases and SQL. I learned simple commands to retrieve, update, delete and insert data to a database. I also set up TablePlus which is a Graphical User Interface which allows me to see the database much easier than my using psql to return values in a database.

I am continuing to pair-program and today I worked on short SQL exercises to practise SQL and reinforce my understanding.
